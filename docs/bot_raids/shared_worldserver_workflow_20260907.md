# Shared-worldserver workflow status

Updated 2026-09-10. This is the current status. Historical run narratives remain
in Git; failed assumptions and bounded next repairs belong in the
[error ledger](error_ledger.md). Closed generated evidence is tracked by DVC.

## Current run

Native source `b1132dd087de9216c1d77694a8d7b37ddc209955` cleared Magmaw 10N
in **156.064 seconds**, with **28,352,550 hostile originated damage** and
**181,672.583 exact raid DPS**. Owned pets are included; friendly damage and
mirrored spell 79010 callbacks are excluded. Effective healing over that same
pull-to-death interval is 2,298,732, or **14,729.419 HPS**. The actual roster is
2 tanks, 3 healers and 5 DPS. All ten survived the boss. Fire hook and Affliction
died on Drudges and recovered before the pull. Native exit, zero bots/leases,
cleanup and post-run build verification passed.

| Source | Exact fight seconds | Exact raid DPS | Comparison |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 4b24d7242f | 140.359 | 200,864.383 | Faster benchmark; no living-body return after its first head phase |
| 41266a508c | 151.420 | 186,703.302 | Prior matched setup; current DPS is 2.69% lower |
| 6882d0c204 | 209.211 | 138,307.847 | Primary reviewed baseline; current DPS is 31.35% higher |
| b1132dd087 | 156.064 | 181,672.583 | Current development clear |

Every DPS actor improved against 6882, by approximately 9% to 47%; both tanks
improved. The five DPS contribute 138,633.599 DPS, 33.25% above 6882 but 5.60%
below 41266. Fight length, head exposure and target opportunities remain
comparison variables. This pair does not assign all recovery to one patch.
No controlled retained comparison proves a particular recent gameplay change
caused the original decline. No blind revert or coefficient tuning was made.

## Separate acceptance outcomes

- **Encounter clear: accepted.** Native Magmaw death, exact accounting and
  complete capture are verified. This is not full-raid qualification or training data.
- **Requested repairs: exercised and reviewed.** Optional support admission uses
  actor-specific native LOS and effective action ranges. Production fixtures
  cover blocked optional parasites, mandatory bait/threat, hidden-head to live-body
  binding and simultaneous movement/casting. The live run exercises legal support,
  mandatory bait and fresh body attacks after head disappearance. It does not
  expose every rejected nearby candidate, so fixture and live coverage stay distinct.
- **Overall performance: inconclusive, diagnosis required.** The comparator
  identifies the baseline and matching roster/loadout/profile/route/assets. The
  instance-listener port is an explicit infrastructure-only difference and slower
  full diagnosis is recorded. Legacy target-switch observations are insufficient.
  Healer activity/HPS flags require demand review; lower raid damage taken and zero
  boss deaths do not explain every actor's change. Do not promote all-role throughput.

Preserve accepted tank swaps, native Vengeance, MM haste/filler, Affliction
boss-health potion, Elemental moving Lava Burst and early moving-cast cancellation
repairs. A later unsuccessful cast does not undo the proven interruption repair.

## Timeline and capture

The [timeline tooling](bot_timeline.md) joins existing native combat, trace and
diagnosis records. This run retains 26,345 trace rows and 8,868 combat events,
with no identity rejection or trace/combat gap. Recording-time context separates
proposed/bound/native targets, native action outcomes and stale observations.
The complete HTML has 74,153 joined events, actor/phase/target/spell/time filters
and lazy event details. Chrome filtering and detail expansion were checked.
Lossless packaging is 7,061,175 bytes instead of 213,524,963 bytes; the original
inventoried HTML remains immutable in the evidence archive. Renderer revision
`a9431b973e` is separate from native run revision `b1132dd087`.

CAP-005 retention passed a native 4,097-event pressure emission, all 33 drain
pages and final zero backlog. Its deliberately overflowing actor reports the
expected gap; no unreported loss is accepted. CAP-006 was diagnosed directly in
the first live timeline: the native same-action counter ignored result changes,
so successful attacks contributed to a watchdog failure streak. The repair resets
on outcome changes without relaxing thresholds. The next run crossed both trash
nodes and cleared the boss; reviewed outcome transitions reset correctly.

Five-second diagnosis with two-second trace capture reduced native capture bytes
per elapsed second by 31.39% against 6882. Trace parsing used approximately 0.51%
of one core; mean server CPU changed from 32.255% to 33.720% of one core and peak
RSS increased about 0.59 MB. These are whole-run observations, not isolated proof
of instrumentation CPU cost. Keep aggregate counters, identity/readback receipts
and original raw evidence alongside the timeline in DVC.

## Next bounded work

The original manual head-hide outage remains **DPS-023, cause unknown**. Its
128-row decisions were overwritten. Current successful returns do not disprove
that occurrence or prove its precise cause repaired. Do not retry it unchanged
or claim a universal head-return fix.

Next actionable observation is **OBS-008**: terminal native cast failure reason
and cast-instance correlation remain unavailable. The timeline says so explicitly;
accepted submission, finish and landed effects are separate records. Obtain that
native outcome before guessing why a moving-permitted cast later fails.
Keep DPS-037 (Elemental artificial 12-yard gate), DPS-026/DPS-029 (area protection),
ENC-001 (Drudge safety), HEAL-001 (Holy Paladin capabilities) and OBS-006
(Discipline absorption attribution) visible for separate bounded work units.

## Evidence

Current closed run, prior failed attempts, pressure validation, independent
reviews, focused tests, accounting and capture-cost receipts are bundled under
`artifacts/cata_raid_program/magmaw_development_b1132dd087_20260910.tar.gz.dvc`.
The adjacent publication receipt records fresh empty-cache remote verification
and exact local eviction. Consult it for publication status rather than assuming
that a pointer alone proves uploaded bytes. The compact HTML and reviews remain
locally inspectable; large duplicate payloads are evicted only after verification.

The [active work unit](../../experiments/configs/cata_raid_active_work_unit_v1.json)
closes this canary and routes OBS-008. No additional native run is required for
post-close HTML packaging or comparator/documentation changes.
